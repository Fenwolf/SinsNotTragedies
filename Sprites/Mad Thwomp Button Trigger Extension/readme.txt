Mad Thwomp (Button Trigger Extension), based on Mad Thwomp by RussianMan, original modification by yoshicookiezeus.
Button Trigger Extension by FÃ©n

This thwomp when triggered keeps smashing up'n down.
However, you can instead change it so the thwomp only triggers when a button is pressed.

On Extra bit it'll move up first, otherwise it'll go down first.

Extra byte 1 - Set to nonzero to only smash when a button is pressed

Credit is optional.


Configurations:
mad_thwomp.json - Traditional Mad Thwomp that triggers when Mario gets close and doesn't stop
mad_thwomp_buttontrigger.json - Button-Trigger-Extension-enabled Mad Thwomp that will only trigger on a specific button press
