# Sins, Not Tragedies
I write one but not the other. Super Mario World hacks and code from the mind of FÃ©n.

# What the heck is this?

Your guess is as good as mine. One day I was reading a book on the couch, watching the rain outside the window when what do you know it but a crow flies in. Clearly scared, it frantically flew around. I tried to guide it outside once more, though that avian fiend had other plans; the scars are my proof. Long story short, I'm learning to write decent ASM for Super Mario World romhacking purposes. Some of it will be useful, I promise. Maybe. This is also where I'll release any levels or hacks that I make.

# Support Statement/FAQ

## Help Me?!

You found a bug? Did applying my patch make your computer catch fire? Please file an issue for the former, and get off of GitHub, call 911, and find a good general contractor for the latter.

## But like, you'll help me right? Like, by tomorrow?

I am interested in creating and releasing quality projects. If there's a legitimate bug, I will endeavor to fix it, or find someone who can. That said, it may surprise and shock you to learn that I am a working professional in an unfortunately-fast-paced field. This reality means I explicitly do not guarantee any particular timing for fixes or support. Sorry. Pull requests will always be considered if you decide to fix it yourself and would like to contribute. Also, please do not contact me about issues on Discord or other messaging platforms. I would prefer to keep things localized here.

## Ok so you're a picky, lazy shit. I got [D4](https://www.patreon.com/dtothefourth) to fix it for me. WTF is a Pull Request?

Google is very much your friend here. Contributing to this repository does require a base knowledge of GitHub, git, and pull request workflows. Unfortunately I cannot commit any personal resources (yet?) to put together a guide.
