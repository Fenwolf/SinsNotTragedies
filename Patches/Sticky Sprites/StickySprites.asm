; Sticky Sprites
; Designed by binavik, implementation and SA-1 support by FÃ©n
; Please credit if using this patch
;
; This patch allows you to enable "sticky sprites" on certain levels or all levels.
; "Sticky sprites" means that once the player is holding a sprite (key, throw block,
; koopa shell, etc.), they will not be able to let go until and unless something
; destroys the sprite, the sprite becomes uncarryable (eg galoombas), or Mario dies.

; Set to 1 to enable sticky sprites for all levels
!AlwaysEnabled = 0

; Set this address to a non-zero value in level UberASM to enable sticky sprites for that level.
; Note: Unused with !AlwaysEnabled = 1
!FreeRAM = $7C
